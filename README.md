# daily-planner

The Daily Planner allws the user to plan the day with setting up appointments.

The Planner saves the task on the Local Drive and displays it on the screen for the user. The current task gets displayed in RED and the finished task get displayed  in GRAY and the upcomoing tasks are displayed in GREEN.

I would like to say Thank You to my guide, Jonathan Watson whose videos helped me get through this. I would also like to say Thank You to Sunder Pichai (Google) for providing the support on the World Wide Web.
